              alt=""></section>Pens are so personal. No one pen is the perfect pen for everyone,
          we&rsquo;re all
          different. But these pens are my favorite, &ldquo;never gonna give you up&rdquo;, pens.
          <br>
          <div class="list">
            <ol>
              <li><strong>The TWSBi Eco-</strong> Ergonomically, no, it’s not my favorite. It’s not even the suggested
                grip. It’s the hard drop off past the suggested grip, towards the nib that bothers me. However, the Eco
                is
                such a user friendly pen, you can’t not love it. There’s a reason it’s a top seller.&nbsp; Easy to
                clean,
                works great with even the most stubborn shimmers and pigments (I’m looking at you Pennonia-Strigoi), and
                a
                demonstrator to add to the fun.</li>
              <li><strong>Kaweco Al-Sport-</strong> While I would never, the Kaweco Al-sport is begging to get thrown
                around and beaten up. Put down the kid gloves, these are tough little pens. Unlike the regular Sport,
                the
                Al-Sport has a heft to it that makes it feel significant in your hands. Yes, sometimes you can get a
                less-than desirable nib, but I&rsquo;ve had mostly great experiences. </li>
              <li><strong>Walltown Catsburg-</strong> A maker pen! Working with Walltown is such a delight and the pens
                Brett produces are some of the most stunning I&rsquo;ve seen. These pens feel special in your hand, like
                they&rsquo;re made with love. </li>
              <li><strong>Pilot Custom 823-</strong> Yes, pricey. Yes, vac-fillers can be a pain. But oh the buttery
                nib.
                Chef&rsquo;s kiss. Pilot knows how to make a glass-like nib, and the 823 has a huge #15 nib. Cleaning
                this
                pen is tiring, and if you&rsquo;re OCD about leaving moisture in the barrel, you&rsquo;re best to stay
                far
                away. But that&rsquo;s ok. More for the rest of us. </li>
